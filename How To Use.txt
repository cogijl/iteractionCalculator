Basic code really, just have a csv file where you have the following columns in row 1
variable name, min, max, step

variable name is just for you, it isn't relevant to the calculation

then make sure that you reset the path and file names so that they're correct.


Then after you run it, it'll just spit out a single value, that's the number of
total iterations that you can expect from your model given the parameters you've
specified.
